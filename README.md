## Introduction

Inky Doodle is a single-page application (SPA) that illustrates and explores the biological concepts of hybridization and heredity with the use of imaginary species of "Inky Doodles."
The application itself takes the form of a pedigree chart with three generations. The first generation has a left tree and a right tree with spaces for two
sets of parents. These parents can then be bred to form second generation offspring, which can, in turn, be bred to potentialy create third generation offspring.

Second-generation Inky Doodle mates can only produce viable offpspring if either one or both mates are purebreds or, in the case of both second-generation mates being F1 (filial 1) hybrids, if at least one of each mate's parents is of the same species.
The seven possible combinations of the three generations are as follows, where capital letters (e.g. A, B) designate purebred parents, mixed letters (e.g. Ab, Bc) designate hybrids, and
arrows designate breeding to create a new generation:

<p align="center">A, A, A, A &rarr; A, A &rarr; A</p>
<p align="center">A, A, A, B &rarr; A, Ab &rarr; A</p>
<p align="center">A, A, B, B &rarr; A, B &rarr; Ab</p>
<p align="center">A, A, B, C &rarr; A, Bc &rarr; Abac</p>
<p align="center">A, B, A, B &rarr; Ab, Ab &rarr; Ab</p>
<p align="center">A, B, A, C &rarr; Ab, Ac &rarr; Abac</p>
<p align="center">A, B, C, D &rarr; Ab, Cd &rarr; No Match</p>

The application was built by using React, [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), and [NES.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css). 
All Inky Doodle information including names, parent information, images, and order number are stored in a [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) space and queried as needed by using Contentful's GraphQL API.

Production application added generational title indicators to each individual parent's tree node. 

First generation parent dropdowns also highlight names (with appropriate associated Inky Doodle colors) of parent species selected on the opposite side of the tree
to suggest a next selection that will produce a successful generation 3 offspring.

A randomizer button was also added in production that automatically selects first generation parents according to one of the seven breeding combinations mentioned in the introduction.

Project was deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), custom domain acquired from [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en).
